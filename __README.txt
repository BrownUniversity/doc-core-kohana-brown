Kohana 3 DOC Module README

- With the exception of the Table class, all other classes here are in the doc 
	subdirectory and will have a "DOC_" prefix.

- The "related_files" directory contains the javascript, images, and CSS you will 
	need to make use of the table sorting, paging, and search filter.

- Note that the above does NOT include the core jQuery library or jQueryUI. You 
	will need to pull those in from elsewhere. The code has been tested against 
	jQuery 1.5.x through 1.6.1 and so far seems solid with both.
